# alarm.py
This Python script creates a functional alarm clock with a GUI using tkinter, allowing users to set an alarm time and receive an alert when the specified time arrives. It avoids the need for an external sound file by using alternative methods to generate the alarm sound, such as the winsound.Beep function on Windows or the simpleaudio library, which plays a generated tone on multiple platforms. The alarm function runs on a separate thread to keep the interface responsive, and the interface provides controls for setting the alarm time as well as starting and stopping the alarm.
